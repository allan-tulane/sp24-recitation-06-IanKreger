- **2)** Work = W(n-1) + W(n-2) + 1. O(2^n)

- **3)** Span = S(n-1) + 1. O(n)

- **4)** From the counts list the pattern of the fibonacci sequence emerges. This is because the count adds 1 for each count in the spot of n, which generates the fibonacci sequence. 

- **6)** The maximum number of times is n times. Which makes work and span O(n).

- **8)** The maximum number of times is n-2 times. The work and span is O(n)
